I'm a software engineer mainly using Rust and Golang, but I've also done some cool projects with Python, Java and C++.

Most of the work I've done involves AWS, API and back-end development. I've worked in areas such as algorithmic trading, database design and monitoring, logging and benchmarking tools too.
